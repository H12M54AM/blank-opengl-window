# What is OpenGL
It is a specification thats not a framework or library for c++. It is written by your manufacturer. Open source doesn't mean OpenGL is a software to download. Manufacturers keep their GPU implementation a secret like Nvidia, AMD, Vulkan, Metal. 
- Implemented in Graphics Driver

## Cross-Platform
Works with many platforms. But that doesn't make it better than other specification. 
- May not be the best in the platform itself but its "easy to learn" (The Cherno, 2017).

## What is a shader?
Code that runs on the GPU. Most code written is written on the CPU, but now its on the GPU.  

## Fun Fact
- The Installation binaries is not dependant on the equipment you use. Its dependant on the target architecture and target operating system.
